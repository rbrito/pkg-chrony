Title:          chrony
Version:        1.14
Entered-date:   08AUG00
Description:    A pair of programs for keeping computer clocks accurate.
                chronyd is a background (daemon) program and chronyc is a
                command-line interface to it.  Time reference sources for
                chronyd can be RFC1305 NTP servers, human (via keyboard and
                chronyc), and the computer's real-time clock at boot time
                (Linux only).  chronyd can determine the rate at which the
                computer gains or loses time and compensate for it whilst no
                external reference is present.  chronyd's use of NTP servers
                can be switched on and off (through chronyc) to support
                computers with dial-up/intermittent access to the
                Internet. chronyd can also act as an RFC1305-compatible NTP
                server.
