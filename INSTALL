The software is distributed as source code which has to be compiled.

PARTS OF THE SOFTWARE ARE HIGHLY SYSTEM-SPECIFIC AND NON-PORTABLE.
UNLESS YOU ARE RUNNING A SUPPORTED SYSTEM, BE PREPARED FOR SOME
PROGRAMMING!

After unpacking the source code, change directory into it, and type

./configure

This is a shell script that automatically determines the system type.
There is a single optional parameter, --prefix which indicates the
directory tree where the software should be installed.  For example,

./configure --prefix=/opt/free

will install the chronyd daemon into /opt/free/sbin and the chronyc
control program into /opt/free/bin.  The default value for the prefix
is /usr/local.

If the software cannot (yet) be built on your system, an error message
will be shown.  Otherwise, the files `options.h' and `Makefile' will
be generated.

Now type

make

to build the programs.

Once the programs have been successfully compiled, they need to be
installed in their target locations.  This step normally needs to be
performed by the superuser, and requires the following command to be
entered.

make install

Now that the software is successfully installed, the next step is to
set up a configuration file.  The contents of this depend on the
network environment in which the computer operates.  Typical scenarios
are described in the manual.  The simplest case is for a computer with
a permanent Internet connection - suppose you want to use the NTP
server ntp1.foobar.com as your time reference.  You would create an
/etc/chrony.conf file containing

server ntp1.foobar.com
driftfile /etc/chrony.drift

and then run /usr/local/sbin/chronyd.
