# This server is time-A.timefreq.bldrdoc.gov.  You might be able to Use
# your ISP's nameservers instead.  /usr/doc/chrony/timeservers contains
# URLs for some lists of public time servers.  We use the ip number so that
# chronyd won't try to do a dns lookup on it.  We mark it 'offline' so that
# chronyd won't try to connect when the link is down.  Scripts in
# /etc/ppp/ip-up.d and /etc/ppp/ip-down.d use chronyc commands to switch it
# on when the link comes up and off when it goes down.

# /etc/cron.weekly/chrony as these scripts use it to get the password.
