 chrony (1.26-2) unstable; urgency=low

   * Restored accidently deleted nmu changelog entry.
 .
   * Applied patch from Moritz Muehlenhoff <jmm@debian.org>
     Closes: #655123 Please enabled hardened build flags
 .
   * Fixed upstream.
     Closes: #518385 Chrony segfaults on startup (narrowed down to
     chronyc and "burst")
 .
   * Added DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt to rules.
     Added build-arch and build-indep to rules.
     Prefix is now 'usr'.
     Changed to dh_installman.
     Fixed "clean:" target.
     Closes: #479389 Improvements for debian/rules
 .
   * Fixed upstream.
     Closes: #195620 Strange "System time : xxx seconds slow of NTP time"
     output
 .
   * Upstream changes should have fixed this.
     Closes:#294030 chronyd makes the whole system briefly (< 1 second)
     freeze
 .
   * Fixed by upstream changes and new LSB headers.
     Closes: #407466 Chrony won't access hardware clock but prevents
     hwclock from doing so either
