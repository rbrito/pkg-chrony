Description: It sets your computer's clock from time servers on the Net.
 It consists of a pair of programs :
 `chronyd'.  This is a daemon which runs in background on the
 system.  It obtains measurements (e.g. via the network) of the
 system's offset relative to other systems, and adjusts the system
 time accordingly.  For isolated systems, the user can periodically
 enter the correct time by hand (using `chronyc').  In either case,
 `chronyd' determines the rate at which the computer gains or loses
 time, and compensates for this.
 `chronyc'.  This is a command-line driven control and monitoring
 program.  An administrator can use this to fine-tune various
 parameters within the daemon, add or delete servers etc whilst the
 daemon is running.
