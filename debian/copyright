This is the licence for the programs "chronyd" and "chronyc".  Their
source code files which reference this licence, object files /
programs (binary form) built from such source code, and the supporting
documentation are collectively referred to in this licence as "the
Software".

Certain source code files required for the construction of the Software
may be included under different licensing arrangements; you should refer
to such source code files directly for further information.  Any such
files are outside the scope of this licence.

Person(s) and/or organisation(s) holding the copyright to any part of
the source code to which this licence applies are referred to in this
licence as "the Copyright Holder(s)".

Copying and use of this licence itself, with or without modification,
are permitted for any purpose subject only to condition 6 below.

Copying, use and redistribution of the Software in source and/or binary
forms, with or without modification, and use of any part of the Software
in the creation of another work, are permitted without fee subject to
the following conditions 1 through 8 and the disclaimer below :

1. Redistributions of the Software as source code, in whole or in
   part, with or without modification, must retain all existing
   copyright notices and references to this licence, and must be
   accompanied by a copy of this licence.  You may rename the file
   containing this licence and change all references to it accordingly
   if you need to. Such redistributions must be under terms that require
   this list of conditions and the disclaimer below to be carried on any
   subsequent redistribution.

2. Redistributions in binary form (of the original version of the
   Software, a modified version of the Software, or any other work which
   incorporates any part of the Software), must carry in accompanying
   documentation and/or other materials a notice to the effect of either
   (A) or (B) below.

   (A) This original version of this software was written by
       <name(s) of Copyright Holder(s)> and is used subject to the
       disclaimer in the file <name of file containing the
       disclaimer>.

   (B) The parts of this software which <describe their role in
       your software> were originally written by <name(s) of
       Copyright Holder(s)> and are used subject to the disclaimer in
       the file <name of file containing the disclaimer>.

   (You must replace each <...> with the appropriate information.)
   
   A copy of the disclaimer below must also be included.  Such
   redistributions must be under terms that require the relevant notice
   (A) or (B) and the disclaimer below to be carried on any subsequent
   redistribution.

   As an exception, if all recipients of your distribution receive
   additional rights under condition 5, and those rights supersede the
   disclaimer in its entirety, then you need not include the disclaimer,
   any reference to it, or the requirement for further redistributions
   to carry it.
   
3. Unless modifications to the original Software are retained for the
   exclusive personal use of the modifier, each source code file that
   has been modified must identify the original source version and carry
   a notice describing the nature and purpose of all modifications and
   the person responsible for them.  Where modified source code is
   widely redistributed (e.g. outside the modifier's own organisation),
   it should preferably be supplied as the original version plus
   `patches' which can be applied to the original version to obtain the
   modified version.

4. If a modified version of the Software is distributed in any form,
   it must not be misrepresented (whether by the method of distribution
   or by any related advertisement or documentation) as being the
   original version.  Both the documentation accompanying the software
   and any advertisement related to the distribution must expressly
   state that the distributed software is not the original work, and
   must identify both the original work (by name and version) and the
   nature and purpose of all modifications made.
   
5. You may offer to any party (and charge a fee for) additional
   warranty, liability rights and/or support for the Software (or a work
   derived from it).  Any such offer made must be entirely on your own
   behalf, and you must indemnify the Copyright Holder(s) and all other
   parties through whose redistributions you have received the Software
   for any liability arising out of such an offer.
   
6. This list of conditions and the disclaimer below, when applied
   either to the Software as a whole or to any part of the Software, may
   only be modified by or with the express permission of the Copyright
   Holder(s).

7. The Copyright Holder(s) retain all rights to the Software,
   including without limitation the rights to use the Software for any
   purpose, to create modified and/or enhanced versions of the Software,
   and to distibute such versions under terms different to those in this
   licence.
   
8. Except as required by this licence, the name(s) of the Copyright
   Holder(s) may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from
   the Software without their express permission obtained in advance.
   
== Start of disclaimer ==

BECAUSE THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR IT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT THAT APPLICABLE LAW ALLOWS.  UNLESS
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDER(S) AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE `AS IS'
AND DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES THAT THE SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE OR FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE USER BEARS THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY, ACCURACY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
SOFTWARE AND THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION
IN THE EVENT THAT THE SOFTWARE SHOULD PROVE DEFECTIVE.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE SOFTWARE, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR
DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHICH ARISE FROM THE USE
OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS
OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE SOFTWARE TO OPERATE WITH ANY
OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
