.SH CHRONYD
chronyd is a daemon that sets your clock from the Net and adjusts the system time 
for drift when you are not connected.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B chronyd
.I "[options]"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B chronyd
 This is a daemon which runs in background on the
system.  It obtains measurements (e.g. via the network) of the
system's offset relative to other systems, and adjusts the system
time accordingly.  For isolated systems, the user can periodically
enter the correct time by hand (using 
.B chronyc
).  In either case,
.B chronyd
determines the rate at which the computer gains or loses
time, and compensates for this.
