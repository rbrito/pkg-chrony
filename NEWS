New in version 1.1
==================

Bug fixes
---------

* Made linear regression more resistant to rounding errors (old one
  occasionally generated negative variances which made everything go
  haywire).  Trap infinite or 'not-a-number' values being used to
  alter system clock to increase robustness further.

Other changes/Enhancements
--------------------------

* Support for Linux 2.1 and 2.2 kernels

* New command 'makestep' in chronyc to immediately jump the system
  time to match the NTP estimated time (Linux only) - a response to
  systems booting an hour wrong after summertime/wintertime changes,
  due to RTCs running on local time.  Needs extending to Sun driver
  files too.

* New directives 'logchange' and 'mailonchange' to log to syslog or
  email to a specific address respectively if chronyd detects a clock
  offset exceeding a defined threshold.

* Added capability to log all client/peer NTP accesses and command
  accesses (can be turned off with conf file directive 'noclientlog').
  Added 'clients' command to chronyc to display this data.

* Improved manual mode to use robust regression rather than 2 point
  fit.

* Added 'manual list' and 'manual delete' commands to chronyc to
  allow display of entered timestamps and discretionary deletion of
  outliers.

* If host goes unsynchronised the dummy IP address 0.0.0.0 is detected
  to avoid attempting a reverse name lookup (to stop dial on demand IP
  links from being started)

* Changed chronyc/chronyd protocol so messages are now all variable
  length.  Saves on network bandwidth particularly for large replies
  from chronyd to chronyc (to support the clients command).

* Added bindaddress directive to configuration file, to give
  additional control over limiting which hosts can access the local
  server.

* Groundwork done for a port to Windows NT to compile with Cygwin
  toolkit.  chronyc works (to monitor another host).  sys_winnt.c
  needs finishing to use NT clock control API.  Program structure
  needs adapting to use Windows NT service functions, so it can be
  started at boot time.  Hopefully a Windows NT / Cygwin guru with
  some spare time can take this port over :-)

New in version 1.02
===================

Bug fixes
---------

* Fix error messages in chronyc if daemon is not reachable.

* Fix config file problem for 'allow all' and 'deny all' without a
  trailing machine address.

* Remove fatal failed assertion if command socket cannot be read from
  in daemon.

* Rewrote timezone handling for Linux real time clock, following
  various reported problems related to daylight saving.

Other changes/Enhancements
--------------------------

* Configure script recognizes BSD/386 and uses SunOS 4.1 driver for
  it.

* Log files now print date as day-month-year rather than as a day
  number.  Milliseconds removed from timestamps of logged data.
  Banners included in file to give meanings of columns.

* Only do 1 initial step (followed by a trimming slew) when
  initialising from RTC on Linux (previously did 2 steps).

New in version 1.01
===================

Bug fixes
---------

* Handle timezone of RTC correctly with respect to daylight saving
  time

* Syntax check the chronyc 'local' command properly

* Fixed assertion failed fault in median finder (used by RTC
  regression fitting)

Other changes/Enhancements
--------------------------

* Log selection of new NTP reference source to syslog.

* Don't zero-pad IP address fields

* Add new command to chronyc to allow logfiles to be cycled.

* Extend allow/deny directive syntax in configuration file to so
  directive can apply to all hosts on the Internet.

* Tidy up printout of timestamps to make it clear they are in UTC

* Make 'configure' check the processor type as well as the operating
  system.
